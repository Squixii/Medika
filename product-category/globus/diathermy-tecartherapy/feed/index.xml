					<description><![CDATA[Heal your body by using inner energy and natural tissue and muscle self-regeneration mechanisms. This is the main principle of the therapy based on the new revolutionary diathermy technique (also known as TECARTHERAPY).
Diathermy (TECARTHERAPY) works in either capacitive mode or resistive mode. DiaCaRe 1000 RT can work in resistive mode. Therefore, the biological effect will focus on the tissues with higher resistance more effectively (i.e. on the tissues that contain less water).
DiaCaRe 1000 RT can work in resistive mode at a frequency of 470 KHz with a power of 50 W ac.

The portable DiaCaRe 1000 RT comes with an internal rechargeable battery which makes its use possible even without plugging it in. It is very practical for all those emergency situations where there is no electric outlet.

DIATRODE: unique in its category, this accessory permits the use of special electrode pads, directly applied on the part to be treated, maintaining the effectiveness of the therapy with no need for continuous operator assistance. Supplied.

MONOTRODE: this all-in-one handpiece permits to follow traditional application techniques but in a much simplified manner. There is no need to connect the return electrode, which is already contained in the same bipolar handpiece. Supplied.

DUALTRODE: accessory that consists of a monopolar handpiece and a return electrode pad. Not supplied.

INDICATIONS, APPLICATIONS
Particularly indicated for the treatment of: osteoarthritis, bursitis, cervical arthrosis, chondropathy, contractures, contusions, sprains, strains, lesions, luxations, periarthritis, sciatica, ligament traumas, tendinitis.

REHABILITATION: treatment of all acute and chronic osteoarticular and muscular pathologies.

SPORT APPLICATIONS: to reduce and prevent traumas during athletic training, to favor recovery.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Tecar Therapy is a form of endogenous thermotherapy that stimulates the body's natural repair processes, speeding up tissue recovery time during treatment of injuries and diseases of the musculoskeletal system. Diacare 5000 is the portable device of the Globus Tecar Therapy line and it is enriched with new features.

NEW GRAPHIC INTERFACE: to use the color touchscreen display in an intuitive way.

PRESET PROGRAMS: the new Diacare 5000 offers a list of preset programs to treat the most common disorders of the musculoskeletal system.

NEW PROGRAMS: ability to create new programs and save them in an appropriate memory.

AUTOMATIC TREATMENT: it allows the use of carbon electrodes to be fixed to the patient's body. In this way, the operator will have the opportunity to integrate therapy with manual techniques.

MULTI-FREQUENCY: Diacare 5000 can use different working frequencies. The ability to have multiple frequencies allows the operator to intervene in a timely manner on different tissues, even at different depths.

AUTOMATIC FREQUENCY SCANNING: the program allows, within the same treatment, to transport energy in an uniform way, before in the deeper tissues, then in the middle, and finally in the more superficial tissues.

TRANSDERMAL DELIVERY: the program allows to facilitate the absorption of the active principle of a drug or cream.

ATHERMY TREATMENTS: the athermic program, thanks to the pulsed controlled emission, is modulated to create a biostimulation of the tissue without generating heat.

PULSED TREATMENT: ability to use programs with pulsed emission of different ratio (duty cycle). This allows to maintain high the energy transferred to the tissues preserving, at the same time, a good temperature control.]]></description>
