					<description><![CDATA[Epilmax G-Light 500 is the model of the well proven line of machines IPL Equipped with the new technology PULSED LIGHT. In addition to the traditional feature of removing undesired hair permanently, includes the very new Anti Age function.

HAIR REMOVAL FUNCTION

Laser epilation consists in the use of the laser energy for a definitive hair reduction . Epilmax G-Light emits a flash of very high intensity light energy that get absorbed by the hair’s melanin pigment, thus causing a fast overheating of the hair follicle. The heat destroys the dermal papilla (hair follicle), responsible of the hair’s growth.

REJUVENATION FUNCTION
“Skin photorejuvenation” means a group of dermatological procedures that use specific high-intensity pulsed light sources (IPL), to generate corrective biological effects in the tissues altered by photoaging (sun damage), chronological ageing (age), and other gained alterations Epilmax G-Light can be easily carried and used in comfortably at home; it permits to reduce hair according to your needs, always and everywhere.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[9 CaviMax150 –10 MF-Plus - 5 Adipose Mobilization NorAd-
526 - 2 Man Adiposity - 8 Beauty – 8 Skin

Ultrasonic CAVITATION is the most efficient methodology to fight Cellulite and to eliminate excess fat

MECHANISM:
<ul>
 	<li>When adipose tissue is submitted to deep low frequency ultrasonic energy, a succession of cyclical compression and decompression which produce cavities containing gases and vapours.</li>
 	<li>Thanks to this process, the cavities continue to expand and compress till they explode, destroying in the process the fat cell membrane.</li>
 	<li>The fat contained in the adipocytes is freed and eliminated through blood circulation without damaging the surrounding tissues.</li>
</ul>
THE GLOBUS PROFESSIONAL CAVITATION FREQUENCIES
The cavitation effect is efficiently produced only with low frequencies, lower than 600 KHz, because they are the only one able to penetrate in depth to destroy the adipose tissue. Lower the frequency, deeper is the action of the ultrasonic wave.
- 150 KHz for adiposity and Cellulite less thick and less deep (Professional)
- 526 KHz to associate the adipose destruction with the production of Noradrenalin (NorAd-526) which helps to burn fat thanks to the increase of the metabolism. Specially used for the adiposity of the men abdomen
- 3 MHz for superficial beauty treatments and for skin treatments.

MF PLUS - MULTIFREQUENCY TREATMENTS: GLOBUS WORLD FIRST
Scientific researches have demonstrated that the application of Cavitation with Frequency Modulation (alternation of different frequencies) produce better results because the association of different frequencies allows to act at various depth and allows to personalize the treatment according to the type of cellulite.
